Integrating with MetalK8s
=========================

With a focus on having minimal human actions required, both in its deployment
and operation, MetalK8s also intends to ease deployment and operation of
complex applications, named *Solutions*, on its cluster.

This document defines what a *Solution* refers to, the responsibilities of each
party in this integration, and will link to relevant documentation pages for
detailed information.

What is a *Solution*?
---------------------

We use the term *Solution* to describe a packaged Kubernetes application,
archived as an ISO disk image, containing:

- A set of OCI images to inject in MetalK8s image registry
- An Operator, in `the terms introduced by CoreOS`_, to deploy on the cluster
- Optionally, a UI for managing and monitoring the application, represented by
  a standard Kubernetes ``Deployment``

Once a Solution is deployed on MetalK8s, a user can start creating the
appropriate ``CustomResource(s)`` defined by the Solution Operator, using
either the Solution UI or the Kubernetes API, to effectively deploy one or more
instances of the application packaged in the Solution.

Responsibilities of each party
------------------------------

This section intends to define the boundaries between MetalK8s and the
Solutions to integrate with, in terms of "who is doing what?".

.. Not working on GH: "note:: This is still a work in progress."

**NOTE:** This is still a work in progress.


.. Not working on GH: topic:: MetalK8s

**MetalK8s**::

    MUST:
    - Handle reading and mounting of the Solution ISO archive
    - Provide tooling to deploy a Solution's Operator and UI
    - Provide tooling to upgrade a Solution's Operator and UI

    MAY:
    - Provide tooling to verify signatures in a Solution ISO
    - Expose management of Solutions in its own UI

.. Not working on GH: topic:: Solution

**Solution**::

    MUST:
    - Comply with the standard archive structure defined by MetalK8s
    - Comply with the `CustomResource`s standards defined by MetalK8s
    - Set up its own monitoring

    MAY:
    - Use MetalK8s monitoring services (Prometheus and Grafana)

Interaction diagrams
--------------------

We include detailed interaction sequence diagrams for describing how MetalK8s
will handle user input when deploying / upgrading Solutions.

Their UML definitions will be included in the repository, while generating the
images is left to the user (just run ``make`` from the ``docs/`` directory).

Solution deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `the Solutions deployment diagram definition`_.

.. NOTE: would be interesting to embed the generated images here...

Solution upgrade
